Integrate my feedback on your earlier work (ie, show how you’ve responded to it; if you’ve not logged any work so far, why not?) or any feedback you have received from your peers, summarizing the work you have done to date.

>Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’.

One fail I experienced over these past few weeks was underestimating the task of recording the cemetery stones into kobotoolbox system. I had planned to go to the cemetery and do the fieldwork of recording the stones on a Saturday and to prepare I printed out a map and all the forms I thought I would need for the day to record eacg stone. I estimated there were some number between 15 and 20 but upon arriving I found there were actually 21. Furthermore, at this point I did not realize I was only expected to record between 5 and 10 stones. My friend and I began to do our first stone and it took something like 20 minutes to do it, which was way longer than I had thought it would take. Looking at the monument forms online and printed out, it really did not seem like so much work (maybe it will take 5 minutes per stone, I thought). But once we got there it turned out to be much more complicated: finding the right monument shape codes, filling in the text panel sections, identifying the materials, and all the rest. We ended up just taking the pictures and the measurements of all the monuments so I could fill them in at home where I could use google to help me figure out the differences in materials and other gaps in my knowledge. Even doing only this bare minimum at the cemetery took probably four hours, we ended up being much less productive on that day than I had thought. What I have taken away from this experience are two small lessons: 1. make sure to read through the full instructions at least twice before going out (if I had done this I bet I would have noticed that only 5-10 stones were expected) and 2. do a dry run of whatever the activity is before going out into the field (this would have better helped me to estimate the amount of time nessesary for the recordings).

One win I experienced over the past few weeks was 

>What has been most challenging for you so far, and why is that?

For me, the most challenging aspect of the course so far has been keeping up with the online readings in addition to my other schoolwork. I have already described, in detail, the issues I have had reading on the computer screen in week one. However, I have been adjusting quite well and as the weeks go on I find I am getting used to it. I am taking six courses in total this semester and because this course is so non-synchronous, it ends up being put off until the end of week once I am done with my synchronous classes and other course work during the week. As a result I have not always left myself enough time to complete the work and hence, I have been late with one of my weekly reflections as well as this consolidation document. This is something I will have to work on in future, and the next few weeks are relatively sparce so I plan to get ahead as much as possible in my other courses within that time.

I have always felt that in digital time (and I'm sure this is relevant to digital archaeology as a whole), it feels like time flies at least twice the speed it normally does, and this means that deadlines can sneak up on you even quicker than normal. For this reason, I like to keep my to-do lists and calanders on real physical paper, it makes everything feel much more real and connected to my physical self (which one often loses track of after spending hours on the web).

Another challenge so far has been actually talking about the course to my friends and family. Coming into the course, I might as well have had the idea that digital archaeolgy was about simply using digital tools to help with archaeology, and that would have been somewhat easy to talk to people about. But after reading over some of the first few readings, and especially section in 1.1 of Graham et al.'s *ODATE* which says "It is important at the outset to make the argument that digital archaeology is not about ‘mere’ tool use," this idea of simplicity was shattered. In fact, I found that it has been very hard to agree on any one definition of digital archaeology and it may even make more sense to rather talk about many 'digital archaeologies.' Digital archaeology tools, the varieties of public archaeologies all along the Digital Engagement Spectrum (as described in *Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology*, Elizabeth Bollwerk), digital presentation of archaeological findings, new developments in archaeological map-making (like the knowledge generative approach described in *Geographic Visualization in Archaeology*, Neha Gupta and Rodolphe Devillers) and so much more are all very relevant forms of digital archaeology. This, along with the early focus on digital archaeology ethics, all makes my job of briefly describing the course to my friends and family much harder.

>What are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology?

At the heart of this question is an understanding of what digital archaeology is in general (which I touched upon above). Now knowing that the realm of digital archaeology is so wide, it becomes clear that the implications for doing digital archaeology are just as broad. I will list only a few things here:

In the week 3 podcast, Bill Caraher talks at length about how digital archaeology is forcing us to ask entirely new questions and even to reconsider how we do even the most basic archaeological tasks. He points out how digital copying of information makes intellectual property harder to control: how do we resolve this contradiction? He says we have to consider the relationships between digital technologies and colonial relationships and the relationship between the profits of big tech corporations and the public good (when many of their technologies are so widespread). He asks whether open access is good or if it just reinforces the stardards of a cultural elite. One implication of doing digital archaeology then, will be in finding ways to answer these questions.

Another implication of digital archaeology is the level of digital literacy required for the work. L. Meghan Dennis writes in *Digital Archaeological Ethics: Successes and Failures in Disciplinary Attention*: "By its very nature, if a system cannot be understood by its user, then its user cannot ensure that a formalized ethical compliance is being met, let alone if an aspirational ethical standard is being met." This highlights the importance that in order to do digital archaeology ethically as well as efficiently and correctly, everyone involved ought to have a level of digital literacy high enough to understand the tools being used. Furthermore, it must be observed that not everyone has the same level of access to the technologies required to participate. High speed internet access is not yet a universal luxery around the globe or even in Canada and for that reason many voices are left unheard.

Finally, in order to create large datasets to base findings on in digital archaeology, there is often a lot of nuance to be cut away from real world materials. 

>What are some of the ethical dimensions to the work you’ve encountered so far?


    -graveyard project
        --bad data --> assumptions about data, poor stone knowledge (week 2)
        --permission to record stones (week 2) (engage the community) --> what are the goals? (week 2)
    -mapping --> when we are looking at knowledge generative approaches, a bad map can be much more harmful than just a bad informational map (week 4 notes)
