consolidation document 1 by Archeron1148

>Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’.

One fail I experienced over these past few weeks was underestimating the task of recording the cemetery stones into kobotoolbox system. I had planned to go to the cemetery and do the fieldwork of recording the stones on a Saturday and to prepare I printed out a map and all the forms I thought I would need for the day to record eacg stone. I estimated there were some number between 15 and 20 but upon arriving I found there were actually 21. Furthermore, at this point I did not realize I was only expected to record between 5 and 10 stones. My friend and I began to do our first stone and it took something like 20 minutes to do it, which was way longer than I had thought it would take. Looking at the monument forms online and printed out, it really did not seem like so much work (maybe it will take 5 minutes per stone, I thought). But once we got there it turned out to be much more complicated: finding the right monument shape codes, filling in the text panel sections, identifying the materials, and all the rest. We ended up just taking the pictures and the measurements of all the monuments so I could fill them in at home where I could use google to help me figure out the differences in materials and other gaps in my knowledge. Even doing only this bare minimum at the cemetery took probably four hours, we ended up being much less productive on that day than I had thought. What I have taken away from this experience are two small lessons: 1. make sure to read through the full instructions at least twice before going out (if I had done this I bet I would have noticed that only 5-10 stones were expected) and 2. do a dry run of whatever the activity is before going out into the field (this would have better helped me to estimate the amount of time nessesary for the recordings).

One win I experienced over the past few weeks was 



>What has been most challenging for you so far, and why is that?

For me, the most challenging aspect of the course so far has been keeping up with the online readings in addition to my other schoolwork. I have already described, in detail, the issues I have had reading on the computer screen in week one. However, I have been adjusting quite well and as the weeks go on I find I am getting used to it. I am taking six courses in total this semester and because this course is so non-synchronous, it ends up being put off until the end of week once I am done with my synchronous classes and other course work during the week. As a result I have not always left myself enough time to complete the work and hence, I have been late with one of my weekly reflections as well as this consolidation document. This is something I will have to work on in future, and the next few weeks are relatively sparce so I plan to get ahead as much as possible in my other courses within that time.

I have always felt that in digital time (and I'm sure this is relevant to digital archaeology as a whole), it feels like time flies at least twice the speed it normally does, and this means that deadlines can sneak up on you even quicker than normal. For this reason, I like to keep my to-do lists and calanders on real physical paper, it makes everything feel much more real and connected to my physical self (which one often loses track of after spending hours on the web).

Another challenge so far has been actually talking about the course to my friends and family. Coming into the course, I might as well have had the idea that digital archaeolgy was about simply using digital tools to help with archaeology, and that would have been somewhat easy to talk to people about. But after reading over some of the first few readings, and especially section in 1.1 of Graham et al.'s *ODATE* which says "It is important at the outset to make the argument that digital archaeology is not about ‘mere’ tool use," this idea of simplicity was shattered. In fact, I found that it has been very hard to agree on any one definition of digital archaeology and it may even make more sense to rather talk about many 'digital archaeologies.' Digital archaeology tools, the varieties of public archaeologies all along the Digital Engagement Spectrum (as described in *Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology*, Elizabeth Bollwerk), digital presentation of archaeological findings, new developments in archaeological map-making (like the knowledge generative approach described in *Geographic Visualization in Archaeology*, Neha Gupta and Rodolphe Devillers) and so much more are all very relevant forms of digital archaeology. This, along with the early focus on digital archaeology ethics, all makes my job of briefly describing the course to my friends and family much harder.



>What are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology?

At the heart of this question is an understanding of what digital archaeology is in general (which I touched upon above). Now knowing that the realm of digital archaeology is so wide, it becomes clear that the implications for doing digital archaeology are just as broad. I will list only a few things here:

In the week 3 podcast, Bill Caraher talks at length about how digital archaeology is forcing us to ask entirely new questions and even to reconsider how we do even the most basic archaeological tasks. He points out how digital copying of information makes intellectual property harder to control: how do we resolve this contradiction? He says we have to consider the relationships between digital technologies and colonial relationships and the relationship between the profits of big tech corporations and the public good (when many of their technologies are so widespread). He asks whether open access is good or if it just reinforces the stardards of a cultural elite. Finally, is it OK for researchers to use data from social media in studies: even though it is publicly available permission has not been given for its use. One implication of doing digital archaeology then, will be in finding ways to answer these questions.

Another implication of digital archaeology is the level of digital literacy required for the work. L. Meghan Dennis writes in *Digital Archaeological Ethics: Successes and Failures in Disciplinary Attention*: "By its very nature, if a system cannot be understood by its user, then its user cannot ensure that a formalized ethical compliance is being met, let alone if an aspirational ethical standard is being met." This highlights the importance that in order to do digital archaeology ethically as well as efficiently and correctly, everyone involved ought to have a level of digital literacy high enough to understand the tools being used. Furthermore, it must be observed that not everyone has the same level of access to the technologies required to participate. High speed internet access is not yet a universal luxery around the globe or even in Canada and for that reason many voices are left unheard.

If the original intent of archaeology was simply to find out more about the past through analysing archaeological data and artifacts, and the argument is made that historically this led to the creation of many supporting arguments for colonial and racist world-views (and not to mention the practice of pillaging artefacts from the colonies and bringing them home to display in Europe), can we be sure that we are not making the same mistakes if we are following that same initial intention? In *Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology*, Elizabeth Bollwerk suggests that we should "create programs or projects that address the communities’ expressed needs and interests." I think a good place to start with any archaeological study (digital or otherwise) is to consider deeply what the objective is, which voices are being heard, what assumptions are being made, and what the interests of the involved groups may be. I think this kind of transperency would go quite a way in acknowledging any potential biases, rather than simply stating that the reason for the research is the search for knowledge about the past; It would certainly make the job of any future reviewers the findings a bit simpler.


>What are some of the ethical dimensions to the work you’ve encountered so far?

Arguably the most important step in the graveyard project was obtaining permission to enter a cemetery and record the stones. To do this, I knocked on the door on the house closest to the cemetery (River Road cemetery near Manotick) - he told me that the city maintains the location and he takes care of it himself. After explaining the that it was for my university course work, I was given his permission to enter the site and record the stones. But he clearly cannot speak for all the relatives of those who put up and care for those stones. Furthermore, I'm not totally confident I can say concretely what the data collected will be used for or where it will finally end up. Without reading ahead, I know it will be used for some aspects of the course work, we will be studying the data as a class, and it may be available online - but this is all still awfully vague. If I cannot be 100% sure I know what will happen to the data I cannot be sure it is right to enter it into the system.

Finally, in reducing the cemetery monuments into raw coded information, I hold quite a bit of power in deciding what gets recorded and what does not. The abstraction of real world materials into data is such a delicate task because so much nuance has to be removed. The way that systems (like the kobotoolbox form) are coded often make many assumptions about what is being recorded and these assumptions become encoded in the data. At the analysis stage, these assumptions in the data become hard premises which can affect our conclusion, so it is very important to acknowledge these assumptions.

In a similar vein, when we are considering about knowledge generative approaches in map-making as discussed in *Geographic Visualization in Archaeology* by Neha Gupta and Rodolphe Devillers, this becomes incredibly important: "geographic  visualization  (geovisual)  methods draw  attention  to,  and  harness human  cognition for  information  processing  through  pattern  recognition.  To  facilitate  these capabilities, geovisualization methods aim to create display environments such as multiple linked views  that  enable  visual  investigation  through  interaction  with  information  (Andrienko  et  al. 2011)." A map which simply makes knowledge claims that are biased or poorly argued is bad enough, but if a map (or any other dataset) that is made to facilitate knowledge creation is made with many biases and misleading assumptions baked in, they can very well be led to formulate incorrect conclusions all on their own. This is more harmful because often people become more attached to arguments they create themselves. In conclusion then, it is very important to reduce or explicitly point out assumptions in data in order to mitigate as much as possible their harmful power.
