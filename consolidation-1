consolidation document 1 by Archeron1148

Explicitly situate your discussion with reference to the readings, and to the annotations by the class as a whole (ie, cite and engage with).
Integrate my feedback on your earlier work (ie, show how you’ve responded to it; if you’ve not logged any work so far, why not?) or any feedback you have received from your peers, summarizing the work you have done to date.

analytical ability
engagement with methodology
collaboration
argumentation
professionalization
Situate the emergence and evolution of digital archaeology within the historiography of archaeology more broadly (analytical ability, argumentation)

>Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’.
    -fail --> underestimating the task of recording the stones
        --when on the computer it looks very straight forward and simple
        --but once youre there it is very complicated
        --just goes to show that you have to really familiarize yourself with the task before going at it
        --maybe it would help to do a dry run next time
    -win --> 

>What has been most challenging for you so far, and why is that?

For me, the most challenging aspect of the course so far has been keeping up with the online readings in addition to my other schoolwork. I have already described, in detail, the issues I have had reading on the computer screen in week one. However, I have been adjusting quite well and as the weeks go on I find I am getting used to it. I am taking six courses in total this semester and because this course is so non-synchronous, it ends up being put off until the end of week once I am done with my synchronous classes and other course work during the week. As a result I have not always left myself enough time to complete the work and hence, I have been late with one of my weekly reflections as well as this consolidation document. This is something I will have to work on in future, and the next few weeks are relatively sparce so I plan to get ahead as much as possible in my other courses within that time.
I have always felt that in digital time (and I'm sure this is relevant to digital archaeology as a whole), it feels like time flies at least twice the speed it normally does, and this means that deadlines can sneak up on you even quicker than normal. For this reason, I like to keep my to-do lists and calanders on real physical paper, it makes everything feel much more real and connected to my physical self (which one often loses track of after spending hours on the web).

>What are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology?
    -since it is hard to define digital archaelogoy, its hard to define digital archaeology ethics (week 2)
    -its a new development and it is making us ask new questions about archaeology and reconsider things we havnt considered in a long time (week 2 podcast)
    -tools are often not understood by users at a base level (week 2)
    -an assumption of digital literacy
        --see point above
        --internet access across the globe (???)
        --as someone who has grown up with computers and the internet it is sometimes hard to explain things or see from that perspective
    -in data, a lot of nuance has to be ignored, arguably moreso than in regular archaeology (cemetery stones)

>What are some of the ethical dimensions to the work you’ve encountered so far?
    -graveyard project
        --bad data --> assumptions about data, poor stone knowledge (week 2)
        --permission to record stones (week 2) (engage the community) --> what are the goals? (week 2)
    -mapping --> when we are looking at knowledge generative approaches, a bad map can be much more harmful than just a bad informational map (week 4 notes)
